# TN5000-2025
This repository is established for our manuscript "TN5000: An Ultrasound Image Dataset for Thyroid Nodule Detection and Classification", which will be published at Scientific Data.

Currently, the baseline methods for thyroid nodule detection and classification are publicly available here. And our ultrasound image dataset TN5000 is also available at: https://figshare.com/s/cb6a67f17c04b29e7edd



We respectfully request the researchers utilizing TN5000 dataset cite this paper and dataset in their subsequent publications:
